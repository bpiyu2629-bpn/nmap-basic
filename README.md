Project Title: Scan Local Network for Open Ports
Project Description: Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network exposure.

Description: here a some overview about the project of scanning of an ip address. I have been used here wireshark or nmap for scanning an ip address and from that ip address which ports are open that we cover.

Installation: step1: first,Install Nmap and find your local IP range.
              step2: Find your local IP address and range
              step3: Perform a TCP SYN scan with Nmap
              step4: Analyze packet capture with Wireshark
              step5: Research common services and identify potential security risks
              step6: Save scan results
its all about how can i scan the ip address.
